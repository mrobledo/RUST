# Service and Client example

Rust version of the service/client tutorial, similar to the [Python version](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/WritingServiceClient%28python%29) and [C++ version](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/WritingServiceClient%28c%2B%2B%29).

The two versions have minor differences, so we went with the C++ version to immitate.
